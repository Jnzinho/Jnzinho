# ğŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm JoÃ£o

I'm a web and mobile developer from ChapecÃ³, Brazil, building things people actually use, in a clear, responsive, and easy to maintain way. I've been working with web development since 2022.

I use tools like React, Node.js, React Native with and without expo, TypeScript and more, and enjoy figuring out how everything fits together.
